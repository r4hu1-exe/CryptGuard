# CryptGuard
CryptGuard  is a versatile Python tool for encrypting and decrypting files using XOR and AES algorithms. It provides a straightforward command-line interface for secure file handling, making it easy to protect sensitive data.


## Features

- **XOR Encryption and Decryption**: Apply XOR operations with a user-defined key.
- **AES Encryption and Decryption**: Utilize AES (Advanced Encryption Standard) with user-defined passwords.
- **Text Banner**: Displays a custom ASCII art banner at the start.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pyAesCrypt` library (for AES encryption/decryption)
- `pyfiglet` library (for ASCII art banner)

Install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pyAesCrypt pyfiglet
